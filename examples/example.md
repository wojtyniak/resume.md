# Samuel Vimes

**His Grace, The Duke of Ankh, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch**

Ankh-Morpork, The Discworld | [Cable Street Particulars](https://wiki.lspace.org/Cable_Street_Particulars)

## Summary

A seasoned copper with decades of experience keeping the peace (or at least, a semblance of it) in the most... vibrant city on the Disc. Proven ability to manage diverse teams (including, but not limited to, werewolves, dwarves, trolls, and a gargoyle with a penchant for pigeon-fancying). Expert in applied thaumatology (mostly knowing when to call in a wizard), advanced street-level diplomacy, and the proper application of a truncheon. Seeking to continue serving the public, ideally with less paperwork and more actual policing.

## Experience

### Ankh-Morpork City Watch | Commander

_Many, Many Years - Present (It all blurs together after a while)_

-   Transformed a ragtag bunch of misfits into a (mostly) functioning law enforcement agency.
-   Successfully navigated numerous city-wide crises, often involving dragons, golems, inter-species conflicts, and the occasional sentient pear.
-   Pioneered innovative policing techniques, such as the "Vimes' Boots" theory of socio-economic urban policing.
-   Negotiated treaties, quelled riots (sometimes by starting them, long story), and generally kept the lid on a city that's always simmering.
-   Managed the Watch budget, a feat more terrifying than facing down a horde of angry trolls.
-   Instituted the "copper's hunch" as a legitimate investigative tool, with surprising accuracy.

### Ankh-Morpork City Watch | Captain, Night Watch

_The Murky Past - Until Promotion_

-   Survived. This was a significant achievement in itself.
-   Learned the streets of Ankh-Morpork better than the back of his own hand (which, to be fair, has seen better days).
-   Developed a healthy cynicism and an unhealthy relationship with cheap cigars.

### Various Odd Jobs & Misadventures

_Pre-Watch Years - Best Not Discussed in Polite Company_

-   Acquired a unique set of skills, many of which are surprisingly useful in law enforcement.

## Questionable Expertise

**Urban Pacification:** Crowd control, riot suppression (active and preventative), advanced shouting.
**Inter-Species Liaisons:** Fluent in Grunts, Growls, and Pointed Silences.
**Street Smarts:** Can identify a con artist from a mile away (usually because they're trying to sell him something).
**Weaponry:** Truncheon (Master), Sword (Reluctant User), Disarming Sarcasm (Expert).
**Diplomacy:** Surprisingly effective, mostly by being more stubborn than the other party.

## Notable Achievements

-   Survived multiple assassination attempts (it's practically a hobby at this point).
-   Successfully married Lady Sybil Ramkin (a feat in itself).
-   Consistently solved crimes that baffled more "conventional" thinkers.
-   Once arrested the Patrician. He got better.
-   Maintained a semblance of order in Ankh-Morpork, which is like trying to nail jelly to a wall.
