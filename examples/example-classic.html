        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-content">A seasoned copper with decades of experience keeping the peace (or at least, a semblance of it) in the most... vibrant city on the Disc. Proven ability to manage diverse teams (including, but not limited to, werewolves, dwarves, trolls, and a gargoyle with a penchant for pigeon-fancying). Expert in applied thaumatology (mostly knowing when to call in a wizard), advanced street-level diplomacy, and the proper application of a truncheon. Seeking to continue serving the public, ideally with less paperwork and more actual policing.</p>
